# Logistic Regression – Spam Email Classification (Daily Progress)

This folder contains my daily progress while learning and practicing machine learning.  
The main task here is building a **spam vs ham email classifier** using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF vectorization**.

---

## 🔹 What I Worked On

- Loaded and explored the spam/ham dataset  
- Cleaned text data and removed unnecessary columns  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Converted text to numerical form using **TF-IDF**
- Trained a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Plotted a confusion matrix  
- Checked which words strongly indicate spam or ham

## 🔹 Results

- Achieved around **98% accuracy**  
- Very strong precision and recall for both spam and ham  
- Model correctly identifies most spam emails  
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression works extremely well for text classification

## 🔹 Next Steps

- Try Naïve Bayes or SVM for comparison  
- Experiment with more text preprocessing  
- Add hyperparameter tuning  
- Explore deep learning models later in training
