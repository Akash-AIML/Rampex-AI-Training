Linear Regression

This folder contains the work related to implementing and understanding linear regression using real stock market data. The goal is to explore how numerical features can be prepared, modeled, and evaluated using a simple linear model.

Files included

LinearRegression.ipynb
The main notebook for this task. It covers data loading, preprocessing, feature creation from dates, model training, and evaluation.

NSE-Tata_Global_Beverages_Limited.csv
The dataset used in the notebook. It contains daily stock information such as date, open, high, low, last, close, trade quantity, and turnover.

What this notebook demonstrates

Loading and inspecting stock market data

Converting a date column into numerical features for modeling

Selecting the target variable (Close)

Preparing feature columns for linear regression

Training and evaluating the model

Understanding how feature values influence predictions through model coefficients

Purpose of this task

This work builds a foundational understanding of linear regression before moving on to more advanced concepts like regularization, tree models, and time-series forecasting. The notebook in this folder serves as a reference for handling numerical data and building baseline predictive models.
